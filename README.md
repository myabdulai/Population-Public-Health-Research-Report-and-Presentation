# The Role of Electronic Health Records in Public Health Data Driven Decision-Making
Electronic health records facilitate seamless care coordination. The adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has increased fivefold among physicians and tenfold among hospitals since 2009. This has made it possible for patients and their caregivers to obtain vital personal health information digitally, as well as for electronic public health data reporting, electronic prescription, and interoperable electronic health information exchange.

## Research Question
- What is the impact of Meaningful Use program on the adoption of EHRs by health care provided?
- What is the impact of EHRs adoption on interoperability?
- What is the impact of EHRs adoption on public health reporting?
- How is Michigan Department of Health and Human Services use EHR to improve Health outcomes?

## Methodology
Research was an exploratory research. It aimed to explore the role of EHRs in public Health decision-making by reviewing literatures related to the research topic.

## Findings
- The meaningful use programm has impacted on the adoption EHRs by health care provided. The insentives packages provided in this program motivate health care provided to adopt the use certified EHR and also demonstrate effective use of the EHR. Since 2008, the use of electronic health records (EHRs) among hospitals has increased by 87 percentage points. 96% of nonfederal acute hospitals adopted any form of EHR. 94% and 86% of non-federal hospital adopted any certified EHR and the 2015 edition of certified EHR.
- Exchange of patient health data has grown over the years with the successful implementation of Meaningful use program. With increased adoption of certified EHR, 70% of non-federal hospitals in the United State engaged in data exchange in all the four(4) domains of interoperabiliy in 2023, according to the ONC. This is a 52% point increase between 2018 and 2023.
- Two of the 25 objectives under the meaningfull use stage I promote public health reporting with EHR. Hospitals are required to electronically report immunization data and syndromic surveillance data using their EHR. Backer& et al(2024) indicated that by 2022 90% of hospitals could report immunization data electronically, compared to 63% in 2012.
- Prevalence of HBP in the Michigan state was 34.6% in 2013. Upon increasing the number of federally qualified health centres with appropriate EHRs for treating HBP, training health care providers on how to record information in EHR, the number of the number of clinics reporting controlled hypertension increased significantly, with 63% of patients treated by experienced providers achieving blood pressure control compared to 61% for first-time participants.
